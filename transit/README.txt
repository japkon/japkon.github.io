Thus far, this has been the most time consuming project. It probably took over 15 hours from start to finish. Everything works and looks the way I want it to. I find the user's location, only display the given line that is connected with the correct color, and connect the user to the closest station. If a station marker is clicked in, an info window pops up with upcoming train schedule information. The schedule is written in a table format. The bulk of the time was spent drawing th lines, figuring out how to set an array of info windows, and figuring out how to calculate the closest station to the user's location rather than the initialized location (0,0). Someone in class suggested rearranging function calls to solve the last problem, so after tinkering with the function calling, I was able to figure out how to find the closest stop.
