The assignment contains 4 HTML files with 3 CSS files controlling their style. One of the HTML files' sole purpose is to redirect from http://cs.tufts.edu/~japkon01 to http://japkon.github.io. 

I was able to get each of the remaining three pages to look how I wanted them to by pairing them with CSS files. The only thing I could not implement was the location line ("Medford, MA") of Tufts in the resume.html file. I tried to set its text-align to right so that it would be on the same line as "Tufts University School of Engineering" but all the way on the right of the browser. 

Approximately 4-6 hours were spent on this assignment. I am new to HTML, CSS, and git so it took a lot of figuring out how to use the three in parallel even for a relatively simple assignment.
